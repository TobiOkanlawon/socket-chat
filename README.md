# Introduction

In this project, I want to learn (or relearn) how to use web sockets.

I will be building a chat application with a limited scope.

# Scope

- Join the room, there will be only one room.
- Define your username.
- Send a message.
- Receive messages.
- Send a poke (I want to be able to define a structure for something other than a message)
